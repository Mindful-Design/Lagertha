# Project Lagertha

A UI/UX redesign of the popular Twitch-bot PhantomBot, by [phantombot.tv](https://phantombot.tv/)

**Why create this?** In order to implement PhantomBot with my streaming platform [the Ecosystem](http://bit.ly/MindfulG) I had a need to redesign PhantomBot's UI.

**Why open source?** As I started to work on the redesign I wondered if this could be useful for someone else. I knew PhantomBot were in need of a UI/UX change, and until the official version they are working on comes along I hope someone finds this useful.

If you are interested in what else I have developed, or in the streaming platform I am working on, please don't hesistate to visit [my homepage](http://bit.ly/MindfulG)

## Getting Started

To use this on your own setup, download the repo and replace your web folders with these. Be mindful (pun intended) of the PhantomBot version requirements.

### Prerequisites

At the moment the redesign runs on PhantomBot 2.3.5.2, and as such it needs this version in order to work. I am working on making a version that will follow along with the PhantomBot main branch better.
